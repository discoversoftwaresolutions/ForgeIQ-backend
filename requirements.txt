requests==2.31.0 # General purpose HTTP client (sync)
httpx>=0.27.0,<0.28.0 # Async HTTP client (for SDK, and agents calling other APIs)
redis>=4.6.0,<5.0.0 # For EventBus and SharedMemoryStore

# --- OpenTelemetry (Observability) ---
# Pin to a consistent version set for OTel, e.g., 1.24.0 or 1.25.0
# Check for latest stable compatible versions when implementing.
opentelemetry-api~=1.25.0
opentelemetry-sdk~=1.25.0
opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-http~=1.25.0 # For OTLP/HTTP exporter

opentelemetry-instrumentation-fastapi~=0.46b0 # Corresponds to OTel 1.25.x
opentelemetry-instrumentation-httpx~=0.46b0    # For httpx client used in SDK/agents
opentelemetry-instrumentation-redis~=0.46b0    # For Redis client used by EventBus/SharedMemory

# --- Developer Tools (Linting, Formatting, Testing) ---
flake8>=6.0.0,<7.0.0
black>=24.0.0,<25.0.0
pytest>=7.0.0,<8.0.0
# ruff # Optional: A very fast linter/formatter that can replace flake8, black, isort etc.
# You might also want:
# pytest-asyncio # If you have async test functions for Pytest
# python-dotenv # For loading .env files during local development

# --- Other specific dependencies for your agents or core logic ---
# Add any other packages here as needed by your Python components.
# For example, if CI_CD_Agent uses boto3 for AWS:
# boto3

# For example, if BuildSurfAgent uses the OpenAI client directly:
openai>=1.10.0,<2.0.0
bandit>=1.7.5
